#### Wireframes

![SkillsPageWireframe](/images/SkillsWireframe.PNG "Skills Page Wireframe")
<br>
The above image is a wireframe of what I would like for the Skills page (also will be the landing/home page). The layout of each page will be identical in regards to the footer and the header, however the content on each page will be different. On the skills page, I will most likely have a list of skills. If I wanted to expand on this, each skill could have a paragraph explaining why I possess this skill etc.
<br>

![ArticlesPageWireframe](/images/ArticlesWireframe.PNG "Articles Page Wireframe")
<br>
The articles page wireframe shows that the layout is the same, however each article/blog will be above/below another one. with the most recent appearing at the top. 
<br>

![ProjectsPageWireframe](/images/ProjectsWireframe.PNG "Projects Page Wireframe")
<br>
The projects page will have a grid layout initially showing up to 8 icons with the names of the projects in boxs. If the user wishes to find out more about said project, the will be able to click on it, and follow through to a new page. (new pages will not be available until projects have been done).
